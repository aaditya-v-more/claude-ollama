# Fetches the Sparkle framework the menu bar app links against, into vendor/.
#
# Vendored rather than committed: it is fifteen megabytes of binary that nothing
# here edits, and a pinned version with a checksum says everything a copy in git
# would say about which build is in use. make-app.sh calls this on its own, and
# carries on without the updater if it cannot — a checkout with no network still
# builds an app, it just builds one that cannot update itself.
#
# The same version claude-graft vendors, on purpose: one signing key, one
# framework, one set of surprises to learn about.
